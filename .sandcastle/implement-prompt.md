# TASK

Fix issue {{TASK_ID}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

Pull in the issue using `gh issue view <ID>`. If it has a parent PRD, pull that in too.

Only work on the issue specified.

Work on branch {{BRANCH}}. Make commits and run tests.

# CONTEXT

Here are the last 10 commits:

<recent-commits>

!`git log -n 10 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short`

</recent-commits>

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and fill your context window with relevant information that will allow you to complete the task.

Pay extra attention to test files that touch the relevant parts of the code.

# EXECUTION

If applicable, use RGR to complete the task.

1. RED: write one failing test that describes the desired behaviour — run it and confirm it fails for the right reason
2. GREEN: write the minimum implementation to make that test pass — run it and confirm it passes
3. REPEAT until done
4. REFACTOR the code

**HARD RULES — never break these:**

- Never modify an existing test to make it pass. If a test fails, fix the implementation, not the test. The only exception is correcting a test that was factually wrong about the requirements.
- Never write implementation code before a corresponding failing test exists.
- Tests must assert behaviour (inputs → outputs / observable side-effects), not implementation details (internal function calls, private state).

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Before committing, run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test` to ensure the tests pass.

# COMMIT

Make a git commit. The commit message must:

1. Start with `RUNNER:` prefix
2. Include task completed + PRD reference
3. Key decisions made
4. Files changed
5. Blockers or notes for next iteration

Keep it concise.

# THE ISSUE

If the task is not complete, leave a comment on the issue with what was done.

Do not close the issue - this will be done later.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
